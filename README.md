# OCaml interpreter
This project implements an interpreter written in OCaml. The language features the following:
- Static and Dynamic Typing (`teval`, `typecheck` and `check_from_lang_tval`): The language employs both static and dynamic typing. A static typechecker validates types prior to execution, while a dynamic typechecker monitors types during runtime.
- Functional Operators: The language incorporates several functional operators, including `for_all`, `exists`, `filter`, and `map`.
- Set Operations:  Support exists for a range of set operations such as `maxim`, `minim`, `issubset`, `intersection`, `difference`, `union`, `insert`, `remove`, and `contains`.

# Testing
The project comprises 14 test cases to verify the various language functionalities.

# Extras
- This project was developed from scratch. (Note: This is an older project originally created and distributed by me in 2021 before being uploaded in 2024 to GitHub.)
